# itunes_app

Project by Rama Muhammad Sugiyanto

## Getting Started

Hi! here I use the Flutter framework to work on this project, here I make a duplicate application for iTunes, I also use Architecture Patterns, Design Patterns and state management (BloC) as a base for reactive programming.
I used Atomic Design concepts (a little bit) to make reusable widgets and make the UI clean and responsive.
I use several related libraries to make applications more interactive and easier to maintain, such as:

1. flutter_bloc
2. just_audio
3. dio
4. get_it
